#  BitSave – Bitcoin-Powered STX Savings Vault

**Author:** Marcus David  
**Purpose:** A decentralized savings vault on Stacks where users lock STX for a period and earn on-chain reputation points and achievement NFT badges.

---

##  Overview

**BitSave** is a decentralized, Bitcoin-powered savings protocol built on the **Stacks blockchain**.  
It enables users to **lock STX tokens** for a chosen duration, **earn yield and reputation**, and receive **achievement NFT badges** when reaching certain milestones.

The system combines **DeFi savings mechanics** with **on-chain reputation tracking**, introducing gamification and user trust into a non-custodial savings experience.  
Reputation points reflect a user’s long-term saving habits, while NFT badges serve as collectible proofs of commitment—paving the way for **DAO participation, boosted rewards, and social credit systems** in future versions.

BitSave’s design follows a **modular smart contract architecture**:
- The main contract, `bitsave.clar`, manages deposits, withdrawals, and reward calculations.
- The secondary contract, `bitsave-badges.clar`, handles NFT badge minting and metadata via SIP-009 compliance.

Together, they form a foundation for **trustless savings**, **on-chain identity**, and **reputation-based finance** within the Stacks ecosystem.

-  Withdraw only after lock expiry
-  Earn on-chain reputation points upon withdrawal
-  Auto-mint NFT badges when reaching reputation milestones (1000+ points)
-  SIP-009 compliant achievement badges with metadata
-  Admin can adjust reward rate

| `get-savings(user)` | read-only | Returns user's savings info |
| `get-reputation(user)` | read-only | Returns reputation score |
| `get-reward-rate()` | read-only | Returns current rate |

### BitSave Badges Contract (`bitsave-badges.clar`)

| Function | Type | Description |

| `set-authorized-minter(minter)` | admin | Sets who can mint badges (BitSave contract) |
| `transfer-admin(new-admin)` | admin | Transfers admin role |

##  Development Setup

```bash
# Install Clarinet
npm install -g @hirosystems/clarinet

# Check project validity
clarinet check

# Run tests
npm install
npm test

# (Optional) Run local console
clarinet console
```

### Setting Up Badge System

After deploying contracts, authorize BitSave to mint badges:

```clarity
;; Run this from the deployer account
(contract-call? .bitsave-badges set-authorized-minter .bitsave)
```

---

##  Badge System

Users automatically receive NFT badges when they reach reputation milestones:

- **Threshold:** 1000 reputation points
- **Badge Tier:** Gold - "Loyal Saver"
- **Metadata:** Includes achievement name, tier, and threshold
- **Standard:** SIP-009 compliant NFTs

### How to Earn a Badge

1. Deposit STX with a lock period
2. Wait for the lock period to expire
3. Withdraw your STX
4. If you have ≥1000 reputation points, you'll automatically receive a badge!

**Example:**
- Deposit 10,000 STX
- Reward rate: 10%
- Reputation earned: 1,000 points
- Result: Badge minted on withdrawal 

##  Future Roadmap

-  ~~NFT badges for loyal savers~~ (COMPLETED)
- Multiple badge tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum)
- Time-based and streak badges
- Badge marketplace and trading
- DAO-based governance for reward rates
- Integration with sBTC for Bitcoin yield vaults
